# README generator

## Description

In this project, we are making a README file from scratch. You are going to need to run the index.js file inside of your terminal first. Once you run the file, then you are going to be prompted with a couple of basic questions that are going to build your README. Then, once you're done it is going to generate a README file for you.

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
